This is the code I implimented in python to shedule auto entry to my online classes in 3rd sem eachday.
This is for webex and Gmeet in my PC
It also opens OBS studio through cmd in windows before starting class
(The impliment code is based on my PC. U can change it accordingly)
Store the links for ur classes in corresponding variables.
