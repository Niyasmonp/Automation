This folder contains both Arduino and Python code
Arduino code is used to get distance of our hand from ultrasonic sensor and
this data is sent through serial port which is taken as input for python program

Using "pyautogui" library in python we can automate keyboard keys to take a screenshot

Whenever the we keep our hand less than 10 cm near Ultrasonic sensor it takes a screenshot
